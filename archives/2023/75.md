背景是这样的，最近在全面整理 webpack 的配置项，为了加深理解和印象，会一个一个地选项去验证。今天看到 [resolve](https://v4.webpack.docschina.org/configuration/resolve/) 模块，然后发现了一个问题，所以有了 [Modify webpack's resolve.mainFiles, resulting in an error when using webpack-dev-server #2801](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/2801)。

> 最终开发人员表示这确实是 bug，将在未来发布的 v4 版本修复。

关于提 ISSUE，由于需要外国友人看得懂，加上我蹩脚的英文，只能全程在谷歌翻译，尴尬哈哈 🤣

### Code

<!--
  If you have a large amount of code to share which demonstrates the problem
  you're experiencing, or your webpack config is very large, please provide a link
  to your repository rather than pasting code. We'd also encourage you to use a
  Github Gist link instead of pasting code. Otherwise, please paste relevant
  short snippets below.

  For bugs, please do consider providing a link to a stripped-down, bare-bones
  repo that can reproduce the problem you're experiencing. Many times, bugs
  aren't actual bugs, but rather specific issues with loaders, plugins, or
  an environment/OS. Problems with complicated or large applications will almost
  always require this to be triaged.

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  resolve: {
    mainFiles: ['fortest'] // Any name, as long as it is not 'index'
  }
}
```

```js
// index.js（entry）
// The directory of components/button contains the fortest.js file
import Button from './components/button'
```


### Expected Behavior

The `resolve.mainFiles` to be used while resolving directories. 

When I import the button component as above, there should be no errors.

### Actual Behavior

But the actual behavior is not the expected result, and the build fails with the following prompt:

```shell
ERROR in (webpack)-dev-server/client?http://localhost:8080
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'strip-ansi' in '/Users/frankie/Desktop/Web/Demo/Temp/temp_webpack/node_modules/webpack-dev-server/client'
 @ (webpack)-dev-server/client?http://localhost:8080 6:16-37
 @ multi (webpack)-dev-server/client?http://localhost:8080 (webpack)/hot/dev-server.js ./src/index.js
```

### Guess

According to the error message, I found...
```js
// node_modules/webpack-dev-server/client/index.js
// ...
var stripAnsi = require('strip-ansi');
// ...
```

```js
// node_modules/strip-ansi/index.js
// ...
var ansiRegex = require('ansi-regex')();
// ...
```

I found the package.json of the two dependency packages `strip-ansi` and `ansi-regex` does not contain the `main` attribute, so it should look for `index.js` according to the default configuration of webpack. But now because I modified the `resolve.mainFiles` configuration to `fortest`, it should be `fortest.js` when parsing, but there is no `fortest.js` file for the two dependent packages. So an error was reported.

To verify my guess, I tried to modify it to:

```js
// node_modules/webpack-dev-server/client/index.js
var stripAnsi = require('strip-ansi/index');

// node_modules/strip-ansi/index.js
var ansiRegex = require('ansi-regex/index')();
```
After the modification, this can be parsed normally without an error.
The button component can also be imported as expected

### For Bugs; How can we reproduce the behavior?

A very simple configuration
```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js'
  devServer: {
    contentBase: './dist',
    hot: true,
    open: true
  },
  resolve: {
    mainFiles: ['fortest'],
  },
  // Other irrelevant configuration...
}
```

```json5
// package.json
{
  "name": "temp_webpack",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "temp demo",
  "license": "MIT",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack-dev-server --config webpack.config.js --colors"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "clean-webpack-plugin": "3.0.0",
    "css-loader": "3.2.0",
    "file-loader": "5.0.2",
    "html-webpack-plugin": "3.2.0",
    "style-loader": "1.0.0",
    "webpack": "4.41.2",
    "webpack-cli": "3.3.10",
    "webpack-dev-server": "3.9.0"
  }
}
```
webpack allows us to modify the `resolve.mainFiles` configuration to specify the file name to be used when resolving the directory. But when I modify it, webpack-dev-server can't work normally.

Is this caused by my configuration error? Or is it a bug?

Thanks,
